# BimDown CLI

TypeScript CLI tool that serves as middleware between AI agents and the BimDown file format. Validates project structure, hydrates CSVs + SVGs into DuckDB for relational queries, and syncs changes back.

## Install

```bash
cd cli
npm install
npm run build
```

## Commands

### `bimdown validate <dir>`

Validate a BimDown project directory. Checks directory structure, CSV headers/required fields/enums, ID format and uniqueness, foreign key references, and SVG strict subset compliance.

```bash
node dist/index.js validate ../sample_data/architectural
```

Output is one issue per line, prefixed with the file path:

```
lv-1/door.csv:3  id "x-1" has wrong prefix, expected "d-"
global/level.csv:5  required field "elevation" is empty
lv-2/walls.svg  forbidden tag <path> found
```

### `bimdown query <dir> <sql>`

Hydrate the project into an in-memory DuckDB instance and execute SQL. All CSV partitions are unioned into logical tables, and computed geometry columns are injected from SVG files.

```bash
# Tabular output
node dist/index.js query ../sample_data/architectural "SELECT id, material, length FROM wall WHERE length > 10 LIMIT 5"

# JSON output
node dist/index.js query ../sample_data/architectural "SELECT id, width FROM door LIMIT 3" --json
```

### `bimdown sync <dir>`

Hydrate into DuckDB, then dehydrate back to files — strips computed columns, re-partitions rows by level, and writes CSVs.

```bash
node dist/index.js sync ../sample_data/architectural
```

### `bimdown info <dir>`

Print project summary: levels with elevations, element counts per level, and totals.

```bash
node dist/index.js info ../sample_data/architectural
```

### `bimdown schema [table]`

Print the resolved schema for a table (or all tables), showing CSV fields, computed fields, types, and constraints.

```bash
node dist/index.js schema wall
node dist/index.js schema        # all tables
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # watch mode
npm test             # run vitest
npm run test:watch   # vitest watch mode
```
